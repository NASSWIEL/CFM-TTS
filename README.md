# Improving Pronunciation in Conditional Flow Matching Neural TTS Models (Ongoing)

This repository will host the development and experiments aimed at improving the pronunciation accuracy of **Conditional Flow Matching (CFM)** neural text-to-speech (TTS) models. The project is part of a research collaboration between [LIUM](https://lium.univ-lemans.fr/) and [Voxygen](https://www.voxygen.fr/home).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to enhance the robustness and pronunciation quality of neural TTS models by:  

- Training a Conditional Flow Matching TTS system on the **Blizzard Challenge 2023** dataset.  
- Evaluating the output with a speech recognition model to measure pronunciation accuracy.  
- Investigating the impact of text-acoustic alignment in conditioning the TTS model.  
- Applying reinforcement learning to reduce transcription errors and improve robustness across speakers and languages.  

⚠️ **This repository is under active development.** The initial setup, experiments, and scripts will be added soon.

Stay tuned for updates, code releases, and experimental results!
